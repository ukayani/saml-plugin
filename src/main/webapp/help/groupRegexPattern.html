<div>
    A regex pattern which will be applied for every group the user belongs to. Intended to be used in 
    conjunction with the <em>Group Replace</em> field to transform a group's name.
    
    <pre>
        Example:
        
        Prefix(\\w+),.*
    </pre>
    
    This pattern would match for all groups that contain the word <em>Prefix</em> followed by some word characters and a comma.
    The pattern also captures the word characters after the <em>Prefix</em>, allowing us to reference this in the <em>Group Replace</em> field.
