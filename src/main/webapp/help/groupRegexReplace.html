<div>
    A regex replacement which will be used to modify matching group names. Intended to be used in
    conjunction with the <em>Group Pattern</em> field to transform a group's name. When the <em>Group Pattern</em> matches
    a group, this replacement is used.
    
    You may use back references to refer to captured groups from the <em>Group Pattern</em> field.

    <pre>
        Example:
        
        Group Pattern = "Prefix(\\w+),.*"
        Group Replace = "$1"
    </pre>

    This pattern would match for all groups that contain the word <em>Prefix</em> followed by some word characters and a comma.
    The pattern also captures the word characters after the <em>Prefix</em> and replaces the group with this capture
    using a back reference ($1).
